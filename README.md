# ambient_sound_monitoring
System for monitoring ambient sound in an individual's environment

Created using ESP32 and STM32 (with some issues)

Improvements: 
- Changing buck converter to one with a higher current limit
- Using JTAG with STM32
- Replacing USB headers with micro-USB headers
- Ground trace missing on motor PCB
